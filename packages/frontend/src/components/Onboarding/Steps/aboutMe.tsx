        Don’t go overboard with every little detail. Include relevant
        highlights. And don’t forget to include your personality. Others may
        have your skills, experience and even education—but your hobbies and
        personality quirks are what make you, you! This can help you stand out
        from the rest, and it makes you more personable. Likeable people have an
        easier time getting hired.
